Assignment: The municipality is worried that the canal- and support boats might pollute the air with their diesel engines. It is your task to figure out if their concern is warranted. Amsterdam wants to advertise this event as Neutral Energy Event. 

•	How many of the canal boats are currently diesel/fossil fuel driven and how many are electrical driven?
-	In 2022, approximately 33% of the vessels in Amsterdam was emission-free. https://openresearch.amsterdam/image/2023/6/28/evaluatie_elektrisch_varen.pdf
-	Of the recreational boats, mostly privately-owned, only 5% are emissions-free, however the commercial vessels, including tourist focused canal boats, 75% was already emissions free in 2020. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-netherlands/amsterdams-boats-go-electric-ahead-of-2025-diesel-ban-idUSKBN20Q1W7 

•	Are there peak times for the canal boats?
Yes, between 15-17h. https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/92981/grachtenmonitor-2022 (pp.7-9)

•	Compare the energy use of canal boats to some other activities. How big is their carbon footprint compared to other activities?
-	The emissions of canal boats in Amsterdam are included within inland shipping numbers. Inland shipping is responsible for 2% of the CO2 emissions of the Mobility & Transport sector. This is not a lot compared to road traffic emissions.

•	Would you consider it economically feasible ?
-	Using electrical boats during the event:
Since already 75% of canal boats are emissions-free, it can be economically feasible to use electrical vessels only. Additionally, since it will be required in Amsterdam to have an electrical vessel from 2025 onwards, this trend will continue, making this aim more feasible. This event can also be used as promotion of this 2025 policy since the event will be held in May 2024. 

-	Being a Neutral Energy Event:

•	How many support boats and vehicles are needed for this event? 
The yearly Amsterdam city swim attracts around 2500 participants. It is expected that this event will attract at least a similar number. According to the route and the number of participants, the number of support boats needed should be calculated by experts. 

•	How many solar panels or wind turbines are needed? 
10 solar panels of 400Wp generate 3.400 kWh in the first year (Vattenfall, n.d.). 
 
•	Would there be any effect on the water quality if there are no canal boats using fossil fuels?
-	Probably yes, the primary benefits of electric boats are lower carbon emissions, reduced air pollution and reduced water pollution. However, the focus in Amsterdam is on reducing air pollution.
