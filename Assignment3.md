Assignment: Amsterdam wants to get a bit of insight in the number of tourists that will make use of AirBnB. Can you advice on or calculate for Amsterdam:

1.	What Amsterdam will receive from tourist tax if the event lasts a week, and you will have 30.000 visitors?

Around 12% of tourists visiting Amsterdam stay in an Airbnb accommodation (Ecorys, 2018). 10% of the turnover is being paid as tourist tax (City of Amsterdam, n.d.). The other tourists mainly stay at hotels. Hotels have to pay 7% of their turnover as tourist tax. Additionally, hotel guests pay €3 per person per night (City of Amsterdam, n.d.). 

30.000 visitors will visit the event and stay for 7 nights. 
o	3.600 people are expected to stay in Airbnb accommodation. The average price of an Airbnb is €254 in Amsterdam. The average occupation would be around 3 people, resulting in 1200 apartments. This results in a tourist tax of  €213.360
o	The other people are expected to stay at hotels, but could also stay at other accommodation, like staying with friend or at campsites. For the sake of the calculation, we estimate that 25.000 people will stay at hotels. Bringing in €525.000 in tourist tax directly.
o	Indirectly, hotels pay 7%. The average hotelroom price in the city is €146 a night (MRA, 2023). For around 12.500 hotel rooms being occupied for 7 nights, this would result in a tourist tax of €894.250. 

2.	Plot the amount of AirBnB locations per neighborhood.
   
With 1382 listings, the neighborhood ‘De Baarsjes – Oud West’ has the most AirBnB locations of all the Amsterdam neighborhoods. The least number of listings, only 39, are found in ‘Bijlmer-Oost’. 

 

4.	Which street in Amsterdam has the most AirBnB apartments?
   
By using the latitude and longitude of the AirBnB listings in Amsterdam, a geolocator could be used to find out in which street the most AirBnB listings are located. 
	It turns out that Hagedoornplein in Amsterdam Noord is the street with the most Airbnb listings, with 12 AirBnB apartments.  


6.	Try to cross reference the data from the AirBnB dataset with the BBGA. Can you figure out if all apartments of AirBnB are designated as housing?

-	Which number of apartments are not rented out all the time but are also used as normal housing?
8350 out of 8386 are not rented out all the time, which creates the expectation that these are also used as normal housing. This means that only 36 listings are available all year. This probably is the result of regulation in Amsterdam (Airbnb, n.d.). 


5.	How many hotel rooms should be built if Amsterdam wants to accommodate the same number of tourists?

14713.5 beds


7.	How many different licenses are issued?
   
The 8386 Airbnb apartments of this database are divided between 7288 different licenses.
