    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Paris is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water
swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City
of Amsterdam thinks it is beter than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics,
snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the
canals of Amsterdam. We were asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the
feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an
environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.</p>
 
    <h2>Overall Advice</h2>
    <p> To advise the city of Amsterdam on organizing a swimming contest through the canals of Amsterdam, the event is divided into four categories: water, energy, housing and transport:</p> 
      
    <p>The swimming contest is dependent on the water quality, which needs to be closely monitored for it to be safe. In our opinion, the best route for the Paralympics in Amsterdam will start at the bridge between Brouwersgracht and Keizersgracht, then the entire canal will be swum, followed by a left turn over the Amstel River to swim along Herengracht. The endpoint is at the bridge between Herengracht and Herenstraat. The headquarters of the event would have to be in the middle of this route; at the tram stop Keizersgracht. 
    Regarding energy, this event could built on Amsterdam's policy of requiring electrically driven vessels. This being a Neutral Every Event could be good PR for the city, yet is expected to be more difficult and expensive to achieve.
    It is expected that lots of tourists will visit Amsterdam for this contest. Spreading them around different neighborhoods and forms of accommodation (hotels, Airbnb, etc.) is recommended. Amsterdam could generate a lot of indirect income through tourist tax this week. 
    Finally, regarding transportation, this route is efficient due to the close proximity of the start and finish to the Central Station. Additionally, lots of bars and restaurants are located along the route. </p>

    To conclude, we would advise the City of Amsterdam to take careful considerations when organizing such an event and to closely monitor the water quality of the canals.
    If the event will happen, taking into account factors like energy, accommodation, and transportation will be necessary. <u>Please see the individual assignments for a more in-depth explanation</u>. With this, we hope to have you informed sufficiently. </p>

    <h2> Remarks </h2>
    <i>We have chosen to show our codes on the website as they justify many of our conclusions.</i>

    <i>During the last workshop we really started to understand the structure of GitHub. Therefore, our github page is not yet very well structured, but we will take this into account for the hackathon.</i>
